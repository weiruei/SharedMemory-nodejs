Shared memory library for nodejs

That is very hard to share the variables value between worker or process in nodejs, so I create it by myself~ 


Please refer to the windows version example.

also it's supported the linux, just require the respective .node file in js.

if you want rebuild the .node file, jusr refer to readme in source folder.
